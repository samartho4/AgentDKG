# Security

## **Access & authentication overview**

Your DKG Node includes a secure, built-in authentication system powered by **OAuth 2.1**, ensuring that both human users and AI agents can safely interact with your node and its APIs.

This section will guide you through:

* **Understanding OAuth 2.1** - why it’s used, and how it enables secure integrations with tools like Cursor, VS Code, and Copilot.
* **Managing users and tokens** - how to create, edit, and assign access scopes through the CLI or **Drizzle Studio**.
* **Securing custom plugins** - applying scoped authorization so only approved users or agents can access sensitive endpoints.

### OAuth

By default, the DKG Node uses **OAuth 2.1** for authentication, powered by:

* `@dkg/plugin-oauth`
* `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (TypeScript framework)

**Why OAuth 2.1?**

* Recommended standard for AI agent integrations.
* Works seamlessly with agents like **VS Code/GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor AI Agent mode**, and other OAuth-compatible clients.
* Supports **Dynamic Client Registration** → AI agents can automatically discover and connect to your DKG Node.

**User data is managed in a built-in SQLite operational database**, which stores:

* User account information (username & password)
* Permissions and access scopes
* OAuth tokens issued by the server
* Manually created authentication tokens

### Creating users

DKG Node includes a script for adding new user accounts with specific permissions.

Run from `apps/agent/`:

```bash
npm run script:createUser
```

Follow the prompts to enter:

* **Username** → unique identifier for the user
* **Password** → a secure password
* **Scope(s)** → permissions (e.g., `"mcp llm"` for full access)

🔍 **Managing users with Drizzle Studio**

* Starts automatically with `npm run dev`
*   Or run manually:

    ```bash
    npm run drizzle:studio
    ```
* Accessible at: [http://local.drizzle.studio](http://local.drizzle.studio/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

With Drizzle Studio, you can:

* View all users
* Edit user information
* Manage permissions/scopes
* Monitor issued tokens

### Creating tokens

OAuth works with **access tokens**. Tokens allow secure, programmatic access to your DKG Node without user interaction.

To create a token, run the following command from `apps/agent/` folder:

```bash
npm run script:createToken
```

Follow the prompts:

* **Scope(s)** → define permissions (e.g., `"mcp llm"`) — more on managing permission scopes in the section [#managing-permission-scopes](security.md#managing-permission-scopes "mention") below
* **Expiration** → choose how long the token should remain valid

**When to use tokens**

* Giving **agents access** to tools and resources on your DKG Node
* Automated scripts and integrations
* Service-to-service communication
* Testing and development
* Apps without user interaction

### Using a token

DKG Node OAuth Tokens are standard **Bearer tokens**. Include them in the `Authorization` header of your API requests, for example:

```http
"Authorization": "Bearer 0198a297-f390-76ad-9208-ffae7e248b17"
```

### Managing permission scopes

Access in the DKG Node is **scope-based**:

* By default:
  * `/mcp` → requires `mcp` scope
  * `/llm` → requires `llm` scope
* Only users or tokens with those scopes can access the corresponding routes.

**IMPORTANT: Custom plugins are not protected automatically**\
When you create custom plugins, you must **assign scopes,** or they’ll be exposed without protection.

To secure them, register plugins in `apps/agent/src/server/index.ts` using `.withNamespace()`:

```ts
const app = createPluginServer({
  // ... other config
  plugins: [
    defaultPlugin,
    oauthPlugin,
    dkgEssentialsPlugin,

    // Protect routes with middleware
    examplePlugin.withNamespace("protected", {
      middlewares: [authorized(["scope123"])],
    }),

    // Custom plugin with its own scope
    myCustomPlugin.withNamespace("protected", {
      middlewares: [authorized(["customscope"])],
    }),
  ],
});
```

In this example, only users or tokens with the `customscope` scope can access your custom plugin.

Scopes are assigned during:

* **User creation** (via `npm run script:createUser`)
* **Token creation** (via `npm run script:createToken`)
* Or later, through **Drizzle Studio**.
