# Rules & token thresholds

In the unified node model, all nodes run the same software. The difference is in how much TRAC is staked:

#### **Edge Node**

* **Stake:** _No stake required_.
* **What it means:** Anyone can spin one up and start publishing/verifying knowledge.
* **Use case:** Perfect for developers, small teams, or community members experimenting with the DKG.
* **Incentives:** No direct staking rewards yet, but you can publish and contribute.

#### **Core Node**

* **Stake:** _50,000 TRAC minimum_.
* **What it means:** Your node graduates into full participation.
* **Use case:** Ready for production, with incentives and delegations enabled.
* **Incentives:**
  * Eligible for rewards when securing the network.
  * Others can delegate their stake to your Core Node, letting you earn operator fees.
