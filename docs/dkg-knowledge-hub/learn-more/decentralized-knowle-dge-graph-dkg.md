### What is the DKG Node?

The DKG Node is the next evolution of the OriginTrail node software — your intelligent gateway into the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). It’s not just infrastructure for publishing, querying, and verifying verifiable Knowledge Assets — it’s also the home of AI-powered DKG Agents that can reason over trusted data, automate knowledge-driven workflows, and interact with external systems. With it, you can create new knowledge, retrieve and validate existing information, and power intelligent applications that operate on a foundation of verifiable, provenance-rich data.

In the OriginTrail ecosystem, there are two types of roles your DKG Node can fulfill:

* **The DKG Edge Node** is designed to operate at the network "edge" and can be set up on anything from laptops and phones to the cloud. They can enrich and utilize DKG knowledge and can operate agents, but are not responsible for hosting the DKG state. Therefore, DKG Edge Nodes do not require TRAC token stake to run — Edge Nodes can fully publish, query, and verify knowledge, but are not eligible for a share of protocol fees (via delegated stake) as they do not contribute DKG services to the wider network, and therefore do not require a high uptime.
* **DKG Core Nodes** can do everything Edge Nodes can, but are intended to run as the "network core" — they are running the DKG and maintain its state, which requires high uptime. A DKG Core Node, therefore, needs a minimum of 50,000 TRAC staked as an economic guarantee, which can be "sponsored" by any ecosystem stakeholder willing to delegate TRAC to it. Once a DKG Core Node is set up and contributing to the network, it earns network publishing fees based on its contribution to the network.&#x20;

## Is it too difficult for me?

Running a DKG Node is designed to be accessible — but like any powerful technology, there’s a **learning curve**. If you’re new to this space, it’s worth familiarizing yourself with a few foundational concepts before diving in:

* **Knowledge Graph basics** – Understand how linked data, ontologies, and verifiable knowledge assets work.
* **Blockchain fundamentals** – Learn how transactions, staking, and gas fees function.
* **AI agent concepts** – Knowing how agents interact with external data (like the DKG) will help you design better applications.
* **Basic terminal & server skills** – Installing and managing a node requires comfort with the command line and deploying services on a VPS.

We recommend exploring our [introductory resources or tutorials if any of these areas are new to you](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-McnF-Jcg4utndKcdeko/s/-McnEkhdd7JlySeckfHM/~/changes/408/dkg-knowledge-hub). And remember — you’re not alone. The OriginTrail Discord community is active and welcoming, with dedicated channels where you can ask questions, troubleshoot issues, and share ideas as you learn.

#### **Next Step: $TRAC: Powering The Knowledge Economy**

Once you understand what a DKG Node does, the next step is learning **how it’s powered**. The following section introduces **$TRAC**, the token that drives the DKG’s decentralized economy — enabling staking, publishing, and the incentive mechanisms that keep the network fair and secure.
