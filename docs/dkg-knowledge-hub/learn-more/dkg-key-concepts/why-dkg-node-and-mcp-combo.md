# Why DKG Node & MCP combo?

## The power couple unleashed

The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) solve different problems — but together, they unlock something far greater.

On their own:

* DKG Nodes turn information into verifiable knowledge that can be published, discovered, and trusted across industries.
* MCP gives AI agents a universal language to safely communicate with tools and data sources.

But when you combine them, you create the missing link for trustworthy AI.

### AI can finally trust its sources

Most AI today works like a student with a foggy memory. It “remembers” patterns from training data but doesn’t actually know where those answers originally came from — which is why hallucinations are so common.

With **MCP**, AI agents can query a **DKG Node** directly. Because the DKG serves **verifiable, cryptographically signed knowledge**, the AI no longer guesses — it reasons with real, trustworthy data that is:

* **Traceable** – Every piece of knowledge carries provenance, showing _who published it_ and _where it originated_.
* **Auditable** – Anyone (including AI) can verify that the data hasn’t been tampered with.
* **Continuously updated** – The DKG is a living knowledge layer, enriched over time by publishers, contributors, and agents themselves.

And that’s where the real power lies: **AI agents don’t just consume knowledge — they can also contribute it.** When an agent discovers new facts, validates existing claims, or generates useful structured information, it can publish those results back into the DKG as verifiable knowledge. That knowledge then becomes part of a shared, trusted foundation that **other agents, apps, and humans** can later tap into — creating a virtuous cycle of intelligence.
